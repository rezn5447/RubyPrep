# Ruby Study List
# Classes, data structures, and iteration are the skills students struggle with the most -- make sure you're solid on using all three of those. But here's the full list of what counts as fair game on the assessment:

# Data types, like boolean and string
    Examples: 
    boolean true and false
    strings - "blablablablablahblabla in quotes"
        - "" - this is also a string
        - " " - this is totally different 
    ? WHAT IS NIL???
     nil is a special value reserved to indicate the absence of value.
    fixnum - integers like 0 and -2 (different from floats)
    bignum - integers that are REALLY HUGE 
    float- 2.00 0.0 is also a float or 6.5 
        .ceil (rounds up) and .floor (rounds down) are used to turn a float into an int 
    
# Conditional statements, including complex ones that use && and ||
    IF / ELSE / ELSIF / WHILE / UNTIL / - Don't forget to put END at the end!
     && only works if both statements are true
     || passes if at least one statement is true
     ! passes if statement is false

    .each {|elt|} / .each do |elt|   end
    .map same as . each
    (for further information on .each/.map see each_map_ary.rb in RubyPrac)
    .select
# Printing information and gathering information from the user
	printing information: puts
	getting input from console from user: gets
	(for further information on writing functions to do user interface stuff, see 5-6-refactor.rb in RubyPrac)
# Control flow, like if/else, while, and so on
	
# Declaring methods with or without parameters
	
# Interpreting method signatures in documentation
	
# The gotchas of implicit return
	(for example, see implicit_return_example.rb in RubyPrac)
# Classes, including attributes, instance methods, attr_reader, and attr_accessor
	
# Reading and writing simple RSpec tests
	(Resdan and Sally's plan: if they ask us for rspec stuff, just reference old rspec stuff)
