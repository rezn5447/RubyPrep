# Orange Tree class
# Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns its height
# and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one year.

# Each year the tree grows taller and after some number of years, the tree should die.

# For the first few years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger trees.

# Of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns the number of oranges in a tree)
# pick_an_orange (which reduces the @orangecount by 1) and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange was - or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this year 
# Make sure any oranges you don't pick one year fall off before the next year
