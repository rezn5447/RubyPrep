# Ruby Study List
# Classes, data structures, and iteration are the skills students struggle with the most -- make sure you're solid on using all three of those. But here's the full list of what counts as fair game on the assessment:

# Data types, like boolean and string
	Examples: 
	boolean true and false
	strings - "blablablablablahblabla in quotes"
		- "" - this is also a string
		- " " - this is totally different 
	? WHAT IS NIL???
	 nil is a special value reserved to indicate the absence of value.
 	fixnum - integers like 0 and -2 (different from floats)
 	bignum - integers that are REALLY HUGE 
 	float- 2.00 0.0 is also a float or 6.5 
 		.ceil (rounds up) and .floor (rounds down) are used to turn a float into an int 
	
# Conditional statements, including complex ones that use && and ||
	IF / ELSE / ELSIF / WHILE / UNTIL / - Don't forget to put END at the end!
	 && only works if both statements are true
	 || passes if at least one statement is true
	 ! passes if statement is false
